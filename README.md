# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** of product reviews using **Machine Learning** techniques. The model classifies reviews as **positive, negative, or neutral** based on their textual content. It leverages **text preprocessing**, **feature extraction (TF-IDF)**, and machine learning algorithms to generate insights from customer feedback.

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML Models)  
- **NLTK** (Text Preprocessing)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** (Feature Engineering)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of product reviews with corresponding sentiment labels (**positive, negative, or neutral**). Preprocessing steps include:  
✅ Tokenization  
✅ Stopword Removal  
✅ Stemming & Lemmatization  
✅ TF-IDF Feature Extraction  

## 🛠️ Model Training  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform text data  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Convert text to numerical representation using **TF-IDF**  
3. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Naïve Bayes  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- The best-performing model is **[Your Model Name]** with an accuracy of **[XX%]**.  
- Visualized sentiment distribution and feature importance using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**.  

## 🔥 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-product-reviews.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-product-reviews
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:  
   ```sh
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Improve accuracy with **deep learning** (LSTM, BERT).  
- Deploy the model as a **web app using Flask/Streamlit**.
